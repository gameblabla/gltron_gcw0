gltron (0.53-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bugsquash party NMU.
  * Make configure script executable before running it
    (closes: #58377, #58405).
  * Updated to policy version 3.5.2: no changes required.
  * Added build dependencies.
  * gltron doesn't actually need svgalib itself, but the old dpkg-shlibdeps
    pulled in a dependency on it due to using ldd. Build-depend on a version
    of dpkg-dev that uses objdump instead (closes: #63121, #71933).
  * Rebuilt with newer libmikmod2, build-depending on it to be safe. I
    believe this fixes the segfault in MikMod_InfoDriver, and I don't
    experience this (closes: #80598); please reopen the bug if it's still a
    problem.
  * Removed obsolete dh_suidregister call.
  * Don't include installation instructions in the binary package.
